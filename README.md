Introduction to Computer Music with Pure Data
==================

![Intro to Computer Music title image](media/intro-computermusic.png)

A seminar introduction to computer music with examples in Pure Data first given in May 2014 - [the slides are up on Academia](https://www.academia.edu/7218890/Introduction_to_Computer_Music_with_Pd).

The idea of this talk is tell composers and musicians all about why computer music is super awesome and that they should all try out Pure Data (Pd).

I've included my [lecture slides](intro-presentation.md) and a set of 12 "first steps" Pd patches to experiment with.

In the lecture, these patches are live-coded on stage, hopefully I'll get a screen cast up at some point.

Have fun! Make some sounds!
